### React Native Pomodoro App ðŸŒ±
### Overview
#### This Pomodoro app is the culmination of my efforts in the Harvard CS50 course, serving as my final project. The app seamlessly combines functionality with a visually appealing design, offering users a unique and customizable Pomodoro experience.

### Features

##### Customizable Settings: Users can personalize their Pomodoro experience by changing background colors and adjusting various settings according to their preferences.
