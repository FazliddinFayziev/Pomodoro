### React Native Pomodoro App ðŸŒ±

#### Overview
This Pomodoro app is the culmination of my efforts in the Harvard CS50 course, serving as my final project. The app seamlessly combines functionality with a visually appealing design, offering users a unique and customizable Pomodoro experience.

#### Features

1. **Audio Feedback:** The app plays soothing audio alerts when a Pomodoro session is complete, prompting users to take breaks or transition to the next task.

2. **Customizable Settings:** Users can personalize their Pomodoro experience by changing background colors and adjusting various settings according to their preferences.
